# Monstar Template
  
Monstar Template - A Scalable and Maintainable Architecture for Developing Mobile-first Responsive WordPress and Static Websites.  
  
  
## Getting Started  

Get started with Monstar, a scalable and maintainable architecture for building responsive, mobile-first web apps or sites.  
Monstar Template helps you build not only fast but scalable and maintainable web apps or sites. With Monstar Template you have a package that is built with the combined knowledge and effort of some great developers, from their methodology, codes, packages, etc...  
  
  
### Theming  
  
Customize Monstar Template with CSS variables or SASS variables for global style preferences for easy theming and component changes.
Here are the CSS variables we include (note that the :root is required). For more info, please check settings.css or the scss code base (mixins, variables etc...).
  
```
:root {
  --primary: #263238;
  --secondary: #37474F;
  --success: #4CAF50;
  --warning: #FF5722;
  --danger: #F44336;
  --info: #2196F3;
  --light: #FAFAFA;
  --dark: #212121;
  --grey-50: #FAFAFA;
  --grey-100: #F5F5F5;
  --grey-200: #EEEEEE;
  --grey-300: #E0E0E0;
  --grey-400: #BDBDBD;
  --grey-500: #9E9E9E;
  --grey-600: #757575;
  --grey-700: #616161;
  --grey-800: #424242;
  --grey-900: #212121;
  --font-family-sans-serif: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Arial, sans-serif, "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji", "Segoe UI Symbol";
  --font-family-monospace: SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, "Liberation Mono", "Courier New", monospace;
}
```
  
### Breakpoints  
  
Monstar Template use a handful of media queries to create sensible breakpoints for layouts and interfaces. 
These breakpoints are mostly based on minimum viewport widths and allow us to scale up elements as the viewport changes.  
  
```
// Extra small devices (410px and up)
@media (min-width: 410px) {...}
  
// Small devices (576px and up)
@media (min-width: 576px) {...}

// Medium devices (768px and up)
@media (min-width: 768px) {...}

// Large devices (992px and up)
@media (min-width: 992px) {...}

// Extra large devices (1200px and up)
@media (min-width: 1200px) {...}
```
  
### Accessibility  
  
Content which should be visually hidden,
but remain accessible to assistive technologies such as screen readers, can be styled using the .sr-only class.
This will ensure that the control becomes visible once focused (for sighted keyboard users).  
  
```
<p class="text-danger">
  <span class="sr-only">Danger: </span>
  This action is not reversible
</p>
```
  
For visually hidden interactive controls, such as traditional “skip” links, .sr-only can be combined with the .is-focusable class. This will ensure that the control becomes visible once focused (for sighted keyboard users).  
  
```
<a class="sr-only is-focusable" href="#site-content">Skip to main content</a>
```
  
Note: To extend template's accessibility please see [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/), [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) and similar accessibility standards and requirements.
